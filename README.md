# My Objective
I want to see if there's a relationship between the natural beauty of an area and the price people are willing to pay in order to live there. 

# Data Sources
I am using the [Natural Amenities Scale](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale.aspx) provided by the USDA for 1993. 

I am supplementing this with updated measures of urbanization, provided by the USDA [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx)

The housing data that I am using as my target, provided by the Census, can be found [here](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=home%20values%202013%20county&t=Housing&g=0100000US.050000&tid=ACSST1Y2013.S2506&hidePreview=true).
