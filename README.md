# Metis Project 2: Beauty and Value

# My Objective
I want to see if there's a relationship between the natural beauty of an area and the price people are willing to pay in order to live there. 

# Data Sources
I am using the [Natural Amenities Scale](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale.aspx) provided by the USDA for 1993. 

I am supplementing this with updated measures of urbanization, provided by the USDA [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx)

The housing data that I am using as my target can be found [here](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/metropolitan-median-area-prices-and-affordability).

I also used population density information from Wikipedia. 

# Tools
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

# Applications
Natural amenity features do capture variation in median home price. Adding them to conventional models can improve predictive power of housing costs per city and county.
